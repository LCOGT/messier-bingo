Messier Bingo
=============

[Charles Messier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Messier) lived in Paris in the 18th century. He wanted to become famous by discovering comets. When he looked through his telescope he often re-discovered objects which were already known and were not comets. So he didn't waste time, each time he found an object that did not move in the sky he catalogued it.

This project creates a bingo game based around the 110 objects in the Messier catalogue displaying images of each object taken with the LCOGT network.
